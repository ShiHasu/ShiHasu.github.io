      I was giving a problem that involved creating a list in Scheme and getting a particular element from that list using the built-in functions called "car" and "cdr'. I created a list called "listA" that contained 7 elements which where the numbers 1 through 7. I then used "care" and a series of 'cdr"s to obtain the desired element. Finall, I used a short hand for 'car" and "cdr" to obtain the sam element in less keystrokes. <a src="code/scheme-list-fun.ss">Here</a> is a the code i wrote.
